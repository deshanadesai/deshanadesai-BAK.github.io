title: Masters Applications to Graduate School: Tips
category: posts
---

Here are some of the things I learnt through the course of a grueling application process to different US/Canada schools 
for my Masters program. I applied for Masters of Science in Computer Science and my interests lie in Machine Learning 
(with an emphasis on Deep Learning) and its applications to Computer Vision.

1. Education Consultancy are not worth your buck. As far as possible, do everything yourself. Look for templates, examples,
dos and don'ts on the internet and you will find everything you need, and more. 

2. Do your own research and find out the program that fits you best. You will be surprised at what you find!
