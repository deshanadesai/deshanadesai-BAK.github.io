Nice to meet you.

Here's a little bit about me: I completed my Bachelor's degree from DAIICT in 2016. I pursued a Masters in Computer Science at NYU Courant after that. After graduating in 2019, I have been working at AiCure. I am passionate about programming, optimizing processes, deep learning and computer vision. I don't post very often but I am trying to change that. In my spare time, I like to watch korean dramas, play board games or explore new places in NYC.

Enjoy!
