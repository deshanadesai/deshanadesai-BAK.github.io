Hello.

I am currently working as Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.
My topics of interest are: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science. <br>
When I am not glued to the computer screen, I will be found reading classics or watching tv shows. Some of my favorite authors are Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens and Elizabeth Gaskell. 
An informal blog dedicated to books, tv shows and random things: [http://desaideshna.wordpress.com/](http://desaideshna.wordpress.com/)

**You can reach me at desai dot deshna at gmail dot com..**

Enjoy!
